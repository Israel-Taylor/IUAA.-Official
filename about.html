            <h2>This website was created by Israel Taylor.<br> I am a student here at kings and I have created
              this website for my Digital Technologies class. Its purpose is to provide the information and
              skills necessary to make a good decision on what university you think is best for you and how
              you could go about applying for this school. As well as to provide a database of websites for spicific
              universities and to guide you through them as they can be very daunting or hard to navigate.<br><br><br>
