To apply for an undergraduate programme, students use the university’s online portal: select a course, submit academic transcripts, proof of English language, a personal statement, and any required references or test scores.
Postgraduate applicants also apply online, generally submitting a bachelor’s degree with a minimum 5.0 GPA on a 9-point scale, plus IELTS 6.5 (no band below 6.0) or equivalent.


5. Admission Requirements
Undergraduates must meet New Zealand University Entrance or equivalent, specifics vary by programme (e.g., Law: high ATAR plus subject prerequisites).
Postgraduate entry requires a relevant bachelor with a good GPA; some fields (e.g., health, business) have further criteria like interviews or test scores. English language requirements include IELTS 6.0 (undergrad) and 6.5 (postgrad).
