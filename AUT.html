AUT: 4. Application Process
AUT’s application system (Arion) allows domestic and international applicants to apply online, submit up to five programme preferences, and attach necessary documents. Undergraduate entry uses university entrance qualification, with deadlines for Semester 1 (apply by December) and Semester 2 (May).
Postgraduate entry is similar: online application, followed by document assessment and offer.

5. Admission Requirements
Undergraduate entry requires University Entrance for domestic students; international equivalents plus English proficiency (IELTS ~6.0).
Postgrad entry often needs a bachelor’s degree (typically ~70% average), relevant experience, and IELTS 6.5+.
Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is accepted, with credits granted for experience and non-tertiary study.

7. Acceptance Rates/Stats
AUT is highly accessible; acceptance rates range from around 50% (some sources) to 91% (others)—reflecting variation by programme. The university has ~29,000 students, ~5,000 of whom are international.

10. Localization
AUT provides tailored entry pathways, including certificate/diploma re-entry and bridging programmes. Domestic and international guidelines are clearly separated and localized per applicant type.

11. Application Tracking
Once submitted, applicants receive an acknowledgement email with a student ID and password for Arion. They can log in to monitor stages (submitted → assessed → offered) and receive communications via the system-->-->
